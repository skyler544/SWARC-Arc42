## Microservices
- Scalability
- Usability

### Pros
1. Scalable
   - For instance: if we have many users who want to share the ride and not as many drivers, we can scale the instances for the passengers more easily.
2. Flexible
   - Not every use case needs a full service
   - Use cases where it makes sense can have their own service
3. Future-proof
   - Eventual technology changes are simpler

### Cons
1. Code overhead
2. Complexity
3. Cost overhead for cloud services?
