Interviewer: Hi, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Can you start by telling me a little bit about yourself and your interest in the ride sharing app project?

Stakeholder: Hi, my name is John and I'm an investor who is interested in the ride sharing app project. I believe that there is a lot of potential in the ride sharing market and I think that this app could be a game-changer. I'm interested in learning more about the project and potentially investing in it.

Interviewer: Great, thank you for sharing that. Can you tell me about your experience investing in technology startups? What do you look for in a potential investment?

Stakeholder: Sure, I've been investing in technology startups for several years now. I look for companies that have a strong team with a clear vision and a well-defined market opportunity. I also look for companies that have a unique value proposition and a competitive advantage over other players in the market.

Interviewer: That's helpful to know. Can you tell me what specifically interests you about this ride sharing app project? What do you think are the potential benefits and risks?

Stakeholder: I think that the ride sharing market is still growing and there is a lot of room for innovation. This app has the potential to disrupt the market with its unique features and value proposition. The benefits could include increased convenience for users and potentially lower costs compared to traditional ride sharing services. However, there are also risks associated with any technology startup, including market saturation, regulatory challenges, and competition from other players in the market.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this. Can you tell me what kind of involvement you would like to have in the project, if any?

Stakeholder: As an investor, I would like to be involved in the strategic decision-making process and have regular updates on the progress of the project. I would also be interested in connecting the project with potential partners and investors in my network.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. Can you also tell me about any concerns or questions you might have regarding the project, its development, or its potential market?

Stakeholder: Of course. One concern I have is the level of competition in the ride sharing market. There are already established players in the market, so it may be difficult for a new entrant to gain traction. Another concern is the regulatory environment, as ride sharing companies have faced challenges in some jurisdictions. Additionally, I would be interested in learning more about the team behind the project and their experience in the ride sharing industry.

Interviewer: Those are all valid concerns. Can you tell me what kind of return on investment you are looking for in this project?

Stakeholder: As with any investment, I'm looking for a strong return on investment. Certainly, one potential way to make money with this ride-sharing app is by implementing a commission-based model. For each ride facilitated through the app, a percentage or fixed fee can be charged to the drivers as a commission. This way, the app can generate revenue based on the volume of rides being booked, allowing for a scalable income stream. Additionally, offering premium subscription plans to drivers that provide additional benefits and features can also be explored as an avenue to generate additional revenue. However, I also understand that this is a high-risk, high-reward industry and there are no guarantees. I would be looking for a potential return that is commensurate with the level of risk involved.

Interviewer: Thank you for your insights. Can you tell me if you have any other questions or comments regarding the project?

Stakeholder: Not at this time, but I would be interested in learning more about the development timeline and any milestones that have been set for the project.

Interviewer: That's great to hear. Thank you for your time and input. We will definitely keep you updated on the project and any further developments.
