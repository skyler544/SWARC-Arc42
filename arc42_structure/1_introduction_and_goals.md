# 1. Introdcution and Goals



Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

- underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system,
- quality goals for the architecture,
- relevant stakeholders and their expectations

## 1.1 Requirements Overview

### Contents

Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract) of requirements. Links to the (hopefully existing) requirements documents, with information where to find it.

### Motivation

From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

### Form

Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format. If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents. 

## 1.2 Quality goals

### Content

The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Donâ€™t confuse them with project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

The ISO 25010 standard provides a nice overview of potential topics of interest:
