# PayPal integration via library

* Context
We don't have capacity at the moment to maintain an in-house payment system.

* Decision
We decided to use the well-established PayPal integration library "Super
Library" for this purpose instead of reinventing the wheel.

* Status
Accepted after a demonstration showed that the implementation is correct for our
use case.

* Consequences
We cannot control the details of the implementation.

# Spring Boot as our Backend Technology
