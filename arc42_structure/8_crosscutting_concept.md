# Cross-cutting Concepts

### Architecture and Design Patterns
  1. Microservice architecture
  2. Design Patterns
     - SOLID Principles
     - Factory pattern, singleton classes, etc.
  3. Domain-driven design
     - The design of our architecture must represent real-world entities such as passengers, drivers, rides, payments, etc. This must be consistent across the entire application.

### 2. Security & Safety
  1. Security
     - Data
     - Humans
  2. Safety
     - Data
     - Humans
  3. Data consistency / eventual consistency
     - We are reliant on growth, so we need to have rules and patterns for consistency that are clear and coherent while relying on eventual consistency for its scalability.
  4. Resilience and fault tolerance

### 3. Development Concepts
  1. Test Driven Development
  2. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
  3. Performance as a first principle
     - The application must work at scale. This is critical to our survival as a business.
  4. Configurability
